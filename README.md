  * You can use the above repo in conjunction with [TPPRBmakeDb](https://github.com/ChaimStanton/TPPRBmakeDb) for making the database for the list in a way that the program in this repo can handle. 
* I'd also like someone to make graphics for the twitter profile picture and banner please see [this repo](https://github.com/ChaimStanton/TPPRBgrapics).
